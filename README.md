You will need to buy M2 standoffs and screws. I suggest buying M2X6mm standoffs from [here](https://www.ebay.com/itm/M2-Female-Brass-Threaded-Column-Standoff-Support-Pillars-Brass-Standoff-Spacer/132421948707?_trkparms=aid%3D1110001%26algo%3DSPLICE.SIM%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20160323102634%26meid%3D9cf608b7cb5b4aae8f5c78cac9619c21%26pid%3D100623%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D5%26sd%3D174331139173%26itm%3D132421948707%26pmt%3D0%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D2047675&_trksid=p2047675.c100623.m-1) and M2x6mm screws from [here](https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Phillips-Machine-Screws-100PCS/dp/B07HGNNCLV/ref=sr_1_25?dchild=1&keywords=m2+pan+head&qid=1595620924&sr=8-25).
